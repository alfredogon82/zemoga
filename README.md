Hello!

My name is Alfredo Gonz√°lez and im a web developer.

I used for this exercise plain js and css since i believe that is not necesary to load a bunch of js scripts and css that im not going to use, it also gives a faster load of the website and i have more control over the code.

I built the backend with php using PDO to interact with the database. Here i attach the database file that has two tables. persons and votes.

To set up the database settings you have to go to classes/database.class.php and write the connection settings. Besides that setting everything is pretty straight-forward the js are in the scripts.js file

Have a nice day.
